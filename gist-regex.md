# Regex Made Simple

This is my assignment for the UofU Coding bootcamp where we take a confusing line of code like this `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` and translate that so anyone can undertand it. So without any further delay lets get to it!!!

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

In this example we will be using this Regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` as our example that I will be picking apart and explaining. The broadstrokes this is making sure that a URL for a webpage foloows proper URL formatting.
