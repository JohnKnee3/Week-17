Interesting Video trying to explain Async functions.

# 17.1.2

Learned about how a stack is last in first out and how pop and push satisfy that.
Also learned how a queue is first in first out and how push and shift satisfy that.
Also met three new terms beyond "push" which I already knew added to the end of an array.
"Pop" removes from the end of an array.
"Unshift" adds to the start of an array.
"Shift" removes from the end of the array.
